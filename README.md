 # montreal map applicaiton 
 Demo:   https://mdjolieca.github.io/montreal-app/
 
 Neighborhood map project for udacity fullstack nanodegree. This is a map of some of the places I have visited in Montreal. The app reads the places data from a google fusion table, so new places can be easily added.  Clicking on a map pin or name in the place's list, opens a popup window featuring wikipedia articles and a google street view photo. There is also a drop down filter menu to limit the pins and places displayed to particular category.  
# Run
 Click the link above or clone repo. If you would like to make this app your own, you will need to create your own fusion tables and get api keys from google.
# APIs
Uses googleapis for map,photo and fusion table data handling. Uses wikipedia API for info about the place selected.
